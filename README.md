# provision-desktop Ansible playbooks

What I use to Provision my personal Desktops with Ansible. The goal is to create a playbooks (and related roles in other repos) to quickly provision: dnf/fedora, yum/rhel and ubuntu/apt based systems for my desktop general usage.  This is not meant to be a highly generic set of playbooks that should work on anyone's hardware and OS, its more for me and for others to get a starting place on their fork.

## Current State NOTICE

* dnf/fedora is tested and target to Fedora 32, from fresh install
* yum/rhel targeted to RHEL 8, fresh install + subscriptions activated (future)
* apt is tested and target to Pop 20.04 LTS, from fresh install

## Bootstrap

Boot Strap Functions:

* Install Ansible and GIT
* Get these playbooks on your machine
* Generate ssh keys
* Set keys up with dependent machines (future)

From a directory you want to store these (ex: `~/dev/desktop-ansible/`)
